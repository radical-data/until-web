Our approach combines volunteer contributions, source integration, and testimonials to honor each individual's story. Discover our journey, methodology, and how you can be a part of the project.",
    "goal": "The ongoing genocide seeks to dehumanise the Palestinian people by reducing them to numbers, anonymous bodies and mass graves. Until is a community effort to collect names, images and stories of the people who have been killed. The database gives name, singularity, and humanity to each person, showing that each death in these statistics are people with lives, loves and joy.",
    "methodology": "Methodology",
    "methodology_description": "Until uses an iterative approach to build the database. People can add sources which are sorted through a hybrid process of automation and moderation. Through this, we combine information from various sources to build as detailed picture as possible.\nWe also invite testimonials and images to give a more complete picture of each of the people in the database.",

    "who_we_are_description": "Until is a community project led by Radical Data with friends and volunteers. The project started a few weeks ago as a way to not be passive while peopleâ€™s agency is taken away. This is an ongoing process of learning. We started this with experience of building similar databases of mass killings in the past, particularly during the dictatorships of Chile and Argentina. Usually, our projects are built collaboratively with the community they are about. Due to internet shutdowns, we are learning how to do this with a diverse collective. This is the first time we are using the approach in a crisis in the present. That has some challenges and we're learning how to deal with them as we go."
